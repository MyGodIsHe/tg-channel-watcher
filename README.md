# tg-channel-watcher

> A simple Python 3 script that checks all the messages sent in a given list
of Telegram channels/supergroups and forwards (to yourself or to someone else)
the ones matching a specified set of patterns.

After you have cloned the repository, run the command
`pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the required dependencies.

You may also want to use a [virtual environment](http://bit.ly/1fhx5mq) for
that.

Then, before running the script, also create a `config.ini` file with your
configuration parameters (see file [example.ini](example.ini) for reference).
